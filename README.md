# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
create one R script called run_analysis.R 
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
    The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## In the run-analysis.R file:
1.load activity labels and data column names

2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Bind data 

4.Load and process X_train & y_train data.

5.Merge test and train data

6.Apply mean function to dataset using dcast function

7.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
